## Intro

"Aloo Achar" is a classic Nepalese  dish commonly served with as part of lunch or also as a starter at dinner parties. The crunchier vegetables are often varied according to taste (or family recipe!) but the dressing remains largely the same.

## Ingredients (10 people)

   * 20 x potatoes
   * 1 x cucumber (sliced lengthwise and diced into 2cm pieces)
   * 5 carrots (diced finely)
   * 1 bunch of green coriander (chopped finely)
   * 1 desert spoon of chilli powder
   * 1 desert spoon of salt
   * 4 x desert spoons of mustard oil
   * 500g green peas (defrosted if frozen, washed in warm water)
   * 200g sesame seeds
   * 1 desert spoon Ffenugreek
   * 1 teaspoon turmeric
   * 4 tablespoons vinegar (or lemon juice)
   * 1 cup of vegetable oil (or sunflower oil)

## How to do it

Boil the potatoes until soft then peel and cut into small pieces. 

Fry the sesame seeds (without oil) until they brown. Wait to cool and grind the seeds into a powder using a grinder machine (or pestle and mortar).

In a large bowl mix the potatoes, cucumber, green peas, coriander, carrots and the powdered sesame seeds

Add to the bowl 1 small cup of water, vinegar, all of the salt and mix again. 

Add chilli powder and turmeric and mix again.
