## Intro

"Aloo Achar" is a classic Nepalese potato dish commonly served with lunch or as a starter at dinner parties. The salad vegetables may be vary according to preference (or family recipe!) but the dressing remains largely the same.

## Ingredients (10 people)

   * 20 x potatoes
   * 1 x cucumber (sliced lengthwise and diced into 2cm pieces)
   * 5 carrots (diced finely)
   * 1 bunch of green coriander (chopped finely)
   * 1 desert spoon of chilli powder
   * 1 desert spoon of salt
   * 4 x desert spoons of mustard oil
   * 500g green peas (defrosted if frozen, washed in warm water)
   * 200g sesame seeds
   * 1 desert spoon Ffenugreek
   * 1 teaspoon turmeric
   * 4 tablespoons vinegar (or lemon juice)
   * 1 cup of vegetable oil (or sunflower oil)

## How to do it

Boil the potatoes until soft then peel and cut into small pieces. 

Fry the sesame seeds (without oil) in a pan until they turn brown. Wait for it to cool and grind the seeds into a powder using a grinder machine (or pestle & mortar).

In a large bowl mix the potatoes, cucumber, green peas, coriander, carrots and the powdered sesame seeds

Add 1 small cup of water along with the vinegar and salt to the bowl and mix again. 

Add the chilli powder & turmeric and mix again.

Meanwhile fry the fenugreek in hot oil until it has darkened and pour the mixture into the bowl as well.

Mix the contents of the bowl one last time and leave for a few minutes to absorb the flavours before serving.
