ustwobies love food, so they Open Source their recipes.

This will stay empty for a while, but the idea is self-publishing a
book at some point and donate benefits to charity.

Or it will only hold a couple of recipes and no one will pay any
attention to it.

Exactly as any other Open Source project out there.
